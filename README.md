Implement log rotation and retention

To implement log rotation and log file retention in the ol0lo project, I would use the following approach:

1. Determine the log file size threshold:
   - Analyze the average log file size and set a threshold above which log rotation should occur.

2. Implement a log rotation mechanism:
   - Create a separate function or module that handles log rotation.
   - When the log file size exceeds the threshold, this function/module will be triggered to rotate the log files.
   - Log rotation can be done by renaming the current log file with a timestamp and creating a new empty log file.

3. Set up a retention policy for log files:
   - Determine the maximum number of log files that should be retained.
   - Delete the oldest log files when the number of log files exceeds the retention limit.

By implementing log rotation and retention, we can prevent the log files from growing infinitely and manage the log files according to a defined policy.
